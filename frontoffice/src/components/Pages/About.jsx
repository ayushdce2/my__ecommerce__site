            Who We Are
          </h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Wholesalio is a B2B platform that helps small and medium-sized buyers in India purchase products easily, safely, and efficiently.

          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In the past, large companies dominated international trade by controlling products, pricing, and information.
Today, with the growth of global logistics and transparent information, small and medium businesses can also participate in cross-border trade and expand faster.

          <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">

            1. Smart Order System
          </h3>
